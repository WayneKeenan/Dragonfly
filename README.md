# Dragonfly

This is Dragonfly, a small (0.7 in. x 1.4 in.) breakout board for ST's latest high-performance, ultra-low-power line of 32-bit microcontrollers: the STM32L4X6 family. Dragonfly uses the STM32L476RE 64-pin LQFP chip package with 512 kB of high-speed flash memory, 128 kB SRAM, running at up to 80 MHz with a single-precision floating point unit.

This is a repository of simple sketches that can demonstrate how to use the Arduino IDE to program Dragonfly to read sensors, send serial output, control radios and displays, etc.

Here's Dragonfly running three RGB leds through the color spectrum using 9 PWM outputs!
